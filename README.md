# Superhero_hunter_app1
This project contains superheroes and their details.It is made using html,css and vanilla javascript. I have used bootstrap also for some designing. You will also need Marvel API.For that,
You need to first create account on "https://developer.marvel.com/account" and take public and private key from there.
Then break down project in three parts:-
1. Create home page containing input box and search button.Link to Favorite page also.
2. Search button navigates you to details page.
3. Details page lets you add superhero to Favorite page through AddToFavorite button.
 Fetch superheroes and work accordingly.
